        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
        <p>In her attic bedroom Margaret Murray, wrapped in an old patchwork quilt...</p>
        <p>sat on the foot of her bed and watched the trees tssing in the frenzied lashing of the wind...</p>
        <p>Behind the trees clouds scudded frantically across the sky...</p>
        <p>Every few moments the moon ripped through them...</p>
        <p>creating wraithlike shadows that raced along the ground...</p>
